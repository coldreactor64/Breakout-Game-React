# Breakout Game React
A modern version of breakout made with React and SVG.

Based off the guide [here](https://medium.com/@geekrodion/breakout-game-with-javascript-react-and-svg-c8c62a3d30c6)
Rebuilt myself, overhauled design, and entire engine.

### Known bugs:

1. Levels are known not to load correctly once complete a level, fix is to refresh the page (being fixed)

2. Once complete, game crashes and doesn't say winning message or return to level 1. (being fixed)
